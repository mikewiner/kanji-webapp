# kanji-webapp

Want to make a webapp that has all images of all 常用漢字 and people need guess a reading to see if they know that kanji.
Maybe make a database with the high scores of users.

Would be interesting to use words or phrases with that to prevent people from guessing readings. Similar to the DJT discord server quiz game.
